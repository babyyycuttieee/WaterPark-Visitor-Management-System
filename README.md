# Visitor Management System Backend Solution

This repository contains the backend solution for a Visitor Management System (VMS), which systematically tracks and records visitors to a secured area. The VMS digitizes the traditional paper-based approach, enabling efficient retrieval of visitor information and ensuring data security. Additionally, features such as parking lot booking are implemented to enhance user experience. The backend solution includes the following components:

## Database Model
The database model is designed using MongoDB, providing a scalable and flexible solution for storing visitor data securely. The schema is designed to efficiently handle visitor information and related data.

## Database Security
The database system is secured to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity. Measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption are implemented to protect sensitive information.

## Backend Server Deployment
The backend server is deployed using Node.js, offering a robust and efficient platform for handling server-side logic. The server is hosted on a cloud platform to ensure scalability and reliability.

## RESTful API Development
Relevant RESTful APIs are developed to facilitate communication between the client and server. These APIs handle various operations such as adding new visitors, retrieving visitor records, booking parking lots, and generating analytics reports.

## Github Progress and API Documentation
The project progress is tracked using Github, allowing for collaboration and version control. Additionally, comprehensive API documentation is provided to assist developers in integrating with the backend system.
